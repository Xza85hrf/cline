# Deep-Cline

A powerful VS Code extension that integrates DeepSeek V3 model, providing an autonomous coding agent right in your IDE. Deep-Cline can create/edit files, run commands, use the browser, and more - with your permission every step of the way.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– **DeepSeek V3 Integration**: Leverages DeepSeek's powerful 671B MoE model with 37B activated parameters
- ðŸ”§ **Autonomous Coding**: Creates and edits files, runs commands, and uses the browser with user oversight
- ðŸ’» **IDE Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with VS Code's interface and workflows
- ðŸš€ **High Performance**: Processes up to 60 tokens/second with 64K context length
- ðŸ“Š **Model Comparison**: Compare outputs from different prompts and analyze performance
- ðŸ”„ **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files or inputs in one session
- ðŸŽ¨ **Enhanced UI**: Rich configuration interface with real-time token usage tracking

## Installation

1. Install the extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. Configure your DeepSeek API key in the settings
3. Start using Deep-Cline from the activity bar
